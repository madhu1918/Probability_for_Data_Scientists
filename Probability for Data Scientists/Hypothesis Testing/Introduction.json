The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.</li><li>Compare the p-value to an acceptable significance value α (sometimes called an α value). If p ≤ α, that the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid.</li></ol>"
